It contains all the data and four python notebook files for cohort selection, feature extraction, and analysis on Emory and Grady hospital sites.

## RBC Transfusion Efficacy Marker

In this study, we introduced $SpO_2/FiO_2$ (SF) ratio as a more suitable metric for evaluating RBC transfusion effectiveness in non-traumatic ICU patients with respiratory physiologic derangements. The SF ratio could be used along with hemoglobin for a better assessment. Delta SF measures the RBC transfusion efficicy.

### Figure: Transfusion efficacy trend with different baseline SFs
Relationship between baseline SF (BSF) and transfusion efficacy (Î”SF). Resultant mean curve (solid red) and its 95% confidence interval (shaded red region) modelled with a cubic-polynomial curve fitting demonstrates an inverse relationship of BSF and delta SF. Modeling parameters of mean fitted curve are as follows: -0.000002, 0.0031, -1.28, 168.5.
