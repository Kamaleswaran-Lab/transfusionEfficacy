## RBC Transfusion Efficacy Marker

In this study, we introduced $SpO_2/FiO_2$ (SF) ratio as a more suitable metric for evaluating RBC transfusion effectiveness in non-traumatic ICU patients with respiratory physiologic derangements. The SF ratio could be used along with hemoglobin for a better assessment. Delta SF measures the RBC transfusion efficicy.
